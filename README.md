# Temp-Manager

> [!NOTE]

## This is a temporary manager I'm trying to write for sheepit so I can get one out faster, since the main project is a fairly big undertaking for me.

## What this should have
- Auto-restart for the clients if they crash.
- Multiple clients from one executable. 
- CLI control so if you want to pause a client for instance you could do `sheepitm pause <name>`

## What I hope to add, but I honestly don't know how hard it will be, so we shall see
- Nvidia driver crashes. The hope would be it could detect the crash, and force restart the machine so it won't hang without any sign of it unless you check the session yourself.
